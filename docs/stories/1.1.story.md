**[Source: docs/architecture.md - Coding Standards]**

### Coding Standards

**ESLint Configuration:**

- TypeScript parser with strict type checking
- Airbnb base style guide
- Prettier integration for formatting
- No unused variables or imports
- Consistent import ordering

**Prettier Rules:**

- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas (ES5)
- Semicolons required
- Line width: 100 characters
- End of line: LF

**Commitlint:**

- Conventional Commits format enforced
- Types allowed: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Format: `type(scope): subject` (e.g., `feat(monorepo): add turborepo configuration`)

### Critical Rules

**[Source: docs/architecture.md - Coding Standards - Critical Rules]**

1. **No console.log in production:** Use structured logging in Workers, Nuxt logging utilities
2. **TypeScript strict mode:** All `tsconfig.json` files must have `strict: true`
3. **No hardcoded secrets:** All sensitive values via environment variables
4. **Workspace dependencies:** Use workspace protocol for internal packages (e.g., `"@websitemage/shared": "workspace:*"`)

### Testing

**Test Strategy for Story 1.1:**

Since this story focuses on infrastructure setup, testing is verification-based:

1. **Verify PNPM workspaces:** Run `pnpm install` and confirm all packages link correctly
2. **Verify Turborepo:** Run `pnpm run build` and confirm task execution and caching
3. **Verify TypeScript:** Run `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` across all workspaces
4. **Verify ESLint:** Run `pnpm run lint` and confirm no errors
5. **Verify Prettier:** Run `pnpm run format` and confirm formatting applied
6. **Verify Git hooks:**
   - Test pre-commit hook with a file change
   - Test commit-msg hook with invalid commit message (should fail)
   - Test commit-msg hook with valid conventional commit (should pass)
7. **Verify .gitignore:** Confirm build artifacts and node_modules are ignored

**No unit tests required for this infrastructure story.**

**[Source: docs/architecture.md - Test Strategy]**

Testing Philosophy: Test-after (tests written during implementation)  
Test Framework: Vitest for unit tests (to be setup in later stories)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Executive Summary

This infrastructure story has been successfully implemented with all seven acceptance criteria met. The monorepo structure is properly configured with PNPM workspaces, Turborepo, TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier, git hooks, and comprehensive documentation. All validation tests pass successfully. A minor configuration inconsistency regarding Prettier line width has been resolved by aligning the architecture documentation with the implementation standard of 100 characters.

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: A (95/100)**

The implementation demonstrates excellent foundational architecture with proper separation of concerns across three workspace packages. All configuration files are well-structured and follow industry best practices:

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Clean monorepo structure with proper workspace isolation
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode correctly enabled across all packages
- ✅ Path aliases properly configured for shared package imports
- ✅ Git hooks functioning correctly with lint-staged and commitlint
- ✅ Turborepo pipeline with intelligent caching strategy
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore excluding all required patterns
- ✅ Professional README with clear setup instructions
- ✅ All workspace packages properly configured with placeholder scripts
- ✅ Prettier printWidth configuration (100) now aligned with architecture documentation

### Requirements Traceability

- When: Developer initializes PNPM workspaces and Turborepo
- Then: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` defines packages, `turbo.json` configures pipeline
- ✅ **VALIDATED:** Confirmed via file inspection and `pnpm run build` execution

**AC2: Workspace structure created with packages/web, packages/workers, packages/shared**

- Given: The monorepo configuration
- When: Workspace directories are created
- Then: Three packages exist with proper package.json configurations
- ✅ **VALIDATED:** All three packages present with correct naming and structure

**AC3: TypeScript 5.3+ configured with strict mode and path aliases**

- Given: TypeScript needs to be configured
- When: Root and workspace-specific tsconfig.json are created
- Then: Strict mode is enabled and @websitemage/shared/\* path alias is configured
- ✅ **VALIDATED:** Confirmed strict: true in root tsconfig, path aliases working, TypeScript compilation successful

**AC4: ESLint, Prettier, and commitlint configured with pre-commit hooks**

- Given: Code quality tools need to be configured
- When: ESLint, Prettier, commitlint, and Husky are set up
