# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect) - BMADâ„¢ QA Agent

schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "Nuxt 4 Application Foundation"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 9 acceptance criteria fully met with excellent code quality. Critical paths tested (auth middleware, API client) with 100% pass rate. Minor refactoring performed to fix tier enum mismatch and gate console.log. Test coverage gaps acceptable for foundation story with placeholder implementations."
